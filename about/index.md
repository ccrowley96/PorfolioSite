Hi.  I'm Cory.  I grew up in Humboldt County, Northern California.

I have dual US / Canadian citizenship and recently graduated from Queen's University in Kingston Ontario (Canada).  At Queen's, I studied Computer Engineering.  Check out some of the [projects](/projectTags/queens) I worked on while studying :)

Right now, I'm interested in listening to & making music, reading, playing video games, and programming.

Starting July 2020, I'll be working as a codermanz @ Microsoft.
