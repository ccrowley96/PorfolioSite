I designed QShare as part of the Queen's Technology Media Association @ Queen's Uni.  The idea was to build an application that was easier to use than the overflowed **Queen's Rideshare Facebook Group**.  I built QShare with the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node).  This app uses the Facebook Login SDK for user login.
