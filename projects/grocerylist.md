I wanted to make it easier for quarantined family and friends to make group shopping lists. GroceryList is an alternative to paper lists and last minute "can you also get" texts. (It also categorizes groceries by department, making shopping even easier)

Each list has a unique 6 character tag. Create a list, share it's tag with your group, and you're good to go! No user accounts, emails, or passwords, just share your tag and your group will automatically be added to your list.

I designed GroceryList to be mobile first in React.js, using Sass and Flexbox for styling. I also built an API server with Node.js and connected it to a MongoDB database to save list data.

This app was super fun to build : ) Let me know if you have any questions about the technical side, or if you'd use something like this!
