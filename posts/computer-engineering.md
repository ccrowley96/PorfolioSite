In June 2020, I graduated from Queen's University with a degree in Computer Engineering.  I wrote this in hopes that some current or future student will learn something useful from my experience.

### Selecting Computer Engineering

Growing up, I was lucky to attend a couple of tech camps.  One on video game map design in Unreal Engine, and another on C++.  I was **definitely** too young to appreciate either of these technologies, but even playing with such powerful tools inspired me.  From then on, I knew technology would be my path.  

In highschool, I took one Java course. I really like building simple programs, and simple pong-like games. I was also exposed to a bit of arduino programming - attempting to build an autonomous quadcopter in my 'maker' class.  Like my exposure to Unreal Engine & C++ when I was younger, that hill was far too steep to climb with my level of experience. What excited me about tech **was its difficulty**.  Building complex things that few understand was addicting to me.  I wanted to learn how to build these things, and how to build them well.

Apart from my meager programming experience, I liked using photoshop, playing video games, and computers in general. So, by the time I graduated from highschool, I knew I wanted to study technology.  I couldn't imagine another four years of vague subject matter.  I needed something concrete and specific to focus on.  Something I liked to do.

I started applying to my dream schools in California and the States.  I applied to: Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, UCSB, UCLA, University of Washington, and Cal Poly, and others, all for Computer Science. I also applied to UBC and Queen's in Canada, being a Canadian citizen meant University would be much cheaper for me at Canadian schools. Plus my Mom, Sister, & Brother all went to Queen's ahead of me.  I applied to UBC for computer science, and applied for computer engineering @ Queen's, without even knowing what computer engineering was - it just sounded more interesting than computer science.

After months of waiting, hoping for good news, I found out that all of the schools I had applied to had rejected my applications, except for University of Washington and Queen's.  I was crushed.  I wanted, so badly, to get into the top schools. I felt like I had the brains and a solid application, so I wasn't sure why my applications hadn't worked.

I ended up choosing Queen's University in Kingston, ON Canada.  Largely because of my family connections there, but also because I liked the idea of studying 'engineering'. I had hoped to study in California nearer to where I grew up, but I didn't get the option.  So I chose computer engineering at Queen's, a Canadian University - 3000 miles away on the East Coast. It sounded challenging, and I felt up to the challenge.

### Queen's Engineering
When I started studying engineering, I felt that I had made a mistake.  I was enrolled in Geology and Chemistry classes.  Exactly what I had hoped to avoid.  I wanted to learn to build software and to build it well.

After making my way through FROSH week, the grease pole, and the overwhelming nature of starting school in a new place, I started my studies.

> "As part of Queen's Engineering Frosh Week, the incoming first-year engineering students must, with the help of the upper-year engineering students, climb to the top of a grease pole and remove a tam which is nailed to the pole's top. The Queen's Grease Pole is a metal football goalpost stolen by Queen's engineering students in 1955 from University of Toronto's Varsity Stadium. Currently, the pole is covered in lanolin and placed in the centre of a pit of muddy water referred to as the "Grease Pit", but from the first climbing of the pole in 1956 to 1988 the pole was covered in axle grease." - <a href="http://skulepedia.ca/wiki/Queen%27s_Grease_Pole" target="_blank">more info</a>

The first year flew by.  I stumbled my way through Chemistry, Linear Algebra, and advanced Calculus - passing all my courses, but still lacking information on software development. That summer, I flew back to California and worked as a morning shift (6am-2pm) Juice Barista in a local grocery store.  One of the cooler jobs I've ever had.

Come August, I flew back to Kingston, ON for my second year before classes began. I had signed up to be a 'FREC' - one of the engineering orientation week leaders.

> "Engineering frosh group leader. Involves painting themselves purple (completely purple) with gentian and slamming a four hundred dollar jacket on the ground while screaming, "you're never going to be a year frosh, you're never going to climb the pole, you're never going to pass 112" - Urban Dictionary

I died my skin purple, sprayed my hair with red, yellow, and blue paint until it was rock hard, molded around 3 rubber chickens forming a mohawk, draped chains around my engineering jacket, and proceeded to welcome the incoming first years.  At the time, it seemed very normal, but looking back -- whaaaaat?  The Jury is still out on what using that much medical grade gentian die does when stained to your body.

That year, I was living in a housing co-op, working as a breakfast chef, making eggs to order and pancakes. Most of the other students in the co-op were foreign exchange students.  This work was one of my highlights at Queen's.  I would put on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/09gRN6vrMBmiZMu3ctF6Gc?si=ghgMY3gMSwW7Q7OzR0FUWA" target="_blank">this playlist</a> every morning and make breakfast for cute girls from France and the UK - what wasn't to like?

That year, I started DJing and purchased some basic DJing equipment, a board, and studio monitors. In the co-op, there was an exchange student band called the Glasgow Kisses. Their drummer, Gavin, wanted me DJ after their house party sets, so I started DJing at parties and events.  I've curated **tons** of setlists and playlists on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1221481626?si=DWj9T9HeTzONcssMVahCiQ" target="_blank">my spotify</a>. DJing was another highlight of my time at Queen's.
